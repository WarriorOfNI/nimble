### Additional requirements

- *User interaction: Do the FAST component's behaviors match the visual design spec? When they differ, which approach is preferable and why?*
- *Styling: Does FAST provide APIs to achieve the styling in the visual design spec?*
- *Testing: Is FAST's coverage sufficient? Should we write any tests beyond Chromatic visual tests?*
- *Documentation: Any requirements besides standard Storybook docs and updating the Example Client App demo?*
- *Tooling: Any new tools, updates to tools, code generation, etc?*
- *Accessibility: keyboard navigation/focus, form input, use with assistive technology, etc.*

- *Performance: does the FAST component meet Nimble's performance requirements?*
- *Security: Any requirements for security?*
